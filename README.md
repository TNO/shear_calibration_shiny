# An interactive dashboard to visualize calibration results


* [Live version](https://rozsasarpi.shinyapps.io/visualize_calibration_results/). Built automatically from the `main` branch of this repository.
* [Code repository](https://github.com/TNO/shear_calibration) to generate results to be visualized.

## Running the code

* Install dependencies using [`renv`](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/): `renv::restore()`. (If it fails then you have to do it manualy, see the `renv.lock` file for the R and package versions used for the development).
* Run the [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app (most conveniently from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)).
