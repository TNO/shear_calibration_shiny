# visualization

* R
* visualization of the results + shiny web server for quick and interactive data exploration.
* A live version (not necessary the most up to date) of the visualization [webserver is available from here](https://rozsasarpi.shinyapps.io/visualize_calibration_results/).
	- it is hosted using the free plan (25 active hours per month for all the hosted apps combined)
* All R files in this folder is set up in a way that the working folder is their location: `\shear_calibration\code\post_processing\visualization\`. But you do not have to worry about this if you use RStudio (seriously, you should use it) as the working directory set programatically.
* `\shear_calibration\code\post_processing\visualization\input\` is the output of `\shear_calibration\code\calibration\`


* copy the csv files from `\shear_calibration\code\calibration\results\` to `\shear_calibration\code\post_processing\visualization\input\`
